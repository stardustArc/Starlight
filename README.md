# Starlight
CoreXY 3D Printer heavily inspired by the Voron Project and using the Reaper toolhead

MOST RECENT VERSION: 

Assembly guide is not provided, and is not/will not be in the works for a while. Downloading CAD is recommended as it will help with assembly, and give an idea of how the printer works.

Starlight uses the Reaper toolhead, the github to which can be found here:

Credit is owed to Voron Design for many concepts for this printer.
