CoreXY 3D Printer heavily inspired by the Voron Project and using the Reaper toolhead

MOST RECENT VERSION: V1.0.1

Assembly guide is not provided, and is not/will not be in the works for a while. Downloading [CAD](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/85d66681291337fe1f04635d/w/bd47415af876ad901f3c4104/e/a603aa6132ba45322da30326) is recommended as it will help with assembly, and give an idea of how the printer works.

Starlight uses the [Reaper](https://apdm.tech/) toolhead, the github to which can be found [here](https://github.com/APDMachine/Reaper)

Credit is owed to Voron Design for many concepts for this printer.
