Designing Starlight has been a rollercoaster of an experience. Below I'll go through the process of designing it, why I made some of the design decisions I did, and go on tangents about some minute detail.

---

Let me preface this by saying that many of the mechanisms and concepts in Starlight are found in the [Voron](https://vorondesign.com/) 2.4 and Trident printers, as I have to get ideas somewhere lol. I did **not**, however, reuse any parts, as 1- they don't fit due to me using 8020's 2020 extrusions, and not Misumi's, and 2- If I'm going use concepts from another project (which I already don't like, but again, gotta get ideas SOMEHOW), I don't want to outright steal the parts involved, so I spent the many tedious hours redesigning parts again, and again, and again (looking at you, XY joints, rev. 3.6). 

# Z-Drive gearboxes-
  Why are they so [boxy](https://c7.alamy.com/comp/RDFKHT/cat-sitting-in-a-small-cardboard-box-and-looking-towards-camera-RDFKHT.jpg), you may ask. And the answer is this: My design skills kinda sucked ass at this point, after the basic frame shape (and only the     lower part of that), the gearboxes were the first thing I designed. If I were to redesign them, I'd probably do something different. For example, the middle section # **[DON'T FORGET TO INSERT IMAGE. ALSO WHILE YOU'R AT IT, MAKE EXPLODED VERSIONS OF ALL SUBASSEMBLIES]** <- if you're reading this when it goes public, and it has a message about exploded subassembly views; someone tell me.  moving on; the middle section (hopefully pictured above) is unfortunately designed in a way that needs supports. Thankfully,  I was able to design it that the side which needs supports is flat, and dimensions non-critical. It's the only part that needs supports, as I designed Starlight to be as supportless as possible.

### Note- You know what, I'll go not in a logical order, but in the order that I designed stuff, as well as logical, to make it extra non-logical (spoiler alert- I put off a lot of important stuff "for later", so some stuff will appear later)

# Frame
I wanted something unique for the frame, and the idea of a DIY belt-driven Prusa XL-esque design appealed to me. Hence the reason of the lack of front extrusions, and the... situation that is housing the z-drive gearboxes. **[insert exploded frame here]**
